                                 Electroplating is the process to cover a conductive object with a layer of metal. Using an electric
                                current, positively charged metal particles (ions) move through a liquid solution (electrolyte) and
                                deposit onto the negatively charged object.

                                There is two common ways to handle parts for plating, the first is rack plating. Rack plated objects
                                are wired or hung individually on a plating rack. Items that are hand finished, or are likely to nest
                                or tangle usually need to be rack plated.

                                Barrel plating is the second common way to plate parts. Barrel-plated items are placed in a

                                 No. Oxidation on the surface will cause the plating to be dull, powdery, and lack adhesion.
                                We can remove oxidation from some types of parts and we will discuss your particular parts with you.

                                 Most stones should be set before plating. However, PERIDOT, CORAL, SHELL, PEARL, HEMATITE, LAPIS LAZULI,
                                MALACHITE, TURQUOISE, and some other softer stones do not always withstand the chemicals involved in our
                                processing. The foil on foil-back type stones will come off during plating. Thermal shock can result in
                                cracks in some types of stones, especially larger ones. We will run a test sample of a suspect type of
                                stone at your request. Make sure all stones are securely set to avoid loss during processing.

                                Hollow parts will plate correctly if there are two holes that are large enough to allow free drainage
                                of the solutions. Beads are not usually a problem but some will not drain freely and cannot be plated

                                  It is best to make every effort to completely clean any soil, polishing compound, or fingerprints from
                                the surface of items before sending them in for plating. Polishing compounds such as Tripoli and rouge
                                are corrosive and will slightly etch the surface if they are not removed soon after use. Ultrasonic
                                cleaning is excellent for cleaning jewelry and component parts.

                                Sometimes parts fall off the plating rack when they cannot be secured to the rack properly. Parts
                                require a through hole, post, closed finding, or other design element that will allow for secure
                                racking. It is also possible for very small, lightweight parts to climb up and out of a plating barrel.
                                  We will make every effort to find lost parts but it is not always possible to locate those that have
                                fallen into large process tanks.   Please see the Red Sky Corporation Statement of Policy at the bottom

                                Plating may increase brightness. Changes in surface brightness can be subtle or great depending on a

                                Red Sky can plate gold anywhere from a flash (about 2 millionths of an inch) to 150 millionths of an inch.
                                We measure gold thickness by x-ray fluorescence and we will provide a written certification of gold thickness
                                upon request. 
                                <br>
                                Generally, the thicker the gold plating the better the wearability. We recommend that you choose
                                the thickest gold plating you can afford. Keep in mind your market niche and the way your
                                jewelry is being advertised when choosing your gold thickness.
                                <br><br>
                                As a guideline, we recommend these minimum thicknesses for the following items:

                            shall end with the carrying out of those instructions. Type of material along with tolerances
                            and specifications for processing shall be declared in writing prior to our processing.

                            material, whichever is lesser. Charges for our services are based on this policy limiting

                            designed, or similar variables over which we have no control, the customer will be expected
                            to pay the amount for the finishing operation performed.
