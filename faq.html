                                 Electroplating is the process to cover a conductive object with a layer of metal. Using an electric
                                current, positively charged metal particles (ions) move through a liquid solution (electrolyte) and
                                deposit onto the negatively charged object.

                                There is two common ways to handle parts for plating, the first is rack plating. Rack plated objects
                                are wired or hung individually on a plating rack. Items that are hand finished, or are likely to nest
                                or tangle usually need to be rack plated.

                <b>What is electroplating?</b>

                <br><br>

                <b>What is rack plating?</b>
                <br><br>
                 There is two common ways to handle parts for plating, the first is rack plating. Rack plated objects
                are wired or hung individually on a plating rack. Items that are hand finished, or are likely to nest
                or tangle usually need to be rack plated.
                <br><br>

                <b>What is barrel plating?</b>
                <br><br>
                Barrel plating is the second common way to plate parts. Barrel-plated items are placed in a
                slowly-rotating, perforated cylinder and processed together as a group.
                <br><br>

                <b>What can be electroplated?</b>
                <br><br>
                 We can plate onto almost any type of metal including brass, bronze, copper, steel, stainless steel,
                tin, pewter, silver, nickel, gold-filled material, and gold. We are not equipped to plate onto aluminum,
                titanium, tungsten, or zinc.
                <br><br>

                <b>Does Red Sky do electroforming?</b>
                <br><br>
                 No. We are not equipped to do electroforming.
                <br><br>

                <b>Does Red Sky do two-tone plating?</b>
                <br><br>
                 We can do two-tone plating on some types of items. Please call us for more information.
                <br><br>

                <b>Does Red Sky re-plate worn out plated items?</b>
                <br><br> 
                No. We are not equipped to repair and re-plate. We aim to do the best plating job possible on
                newly manufactured items.
                <br><br>

                <b>Should objects be assembled before plating?</b>
                <br><br>
                  Usually. In most cases, best results can be achieved when items are completed as if they were
                ready to be sold.
                <br><br>

                <b>Should jewelry be oxidized or antiqued before plating?</b>
                <br><br>
                 No. Oxidation on the surface will cause the plating to be dull, powdery, and lack adhesion.
                We can remove oxidation from some types of parts and we will discuss your particular parts with you.
                <br><br>

                <b> Should pin stems and catches be attached before plating?</b>
                <br><br>
                 Yes. Plating will only slightly restrict the movement of pin stems, catches, and clasps.  
                <br><br>

                <b>Should stones be set before plating?  </b>
                <br><br>
                Most stones should be set before plating. However, PERIDOT, CORAL, SHELL, PEARL, HEMATITE, LAPIS LAZULI,
                MALACHITE, TURQUOISE, and some other softer stones do not always withstand the chemicals involved in our
                processing. The foil on foil-back type stones will come off during plating. Thermal shock can result in
                cracks in some types of stones, especially larger ones. We will run a test sample of a suspect type of
                stone at your request. Make sure all stones are securely set to avoid loss during processing.
                <br><br>

                 <b>Should component parts be glued together before plating?</b>
                <br><br>
                 Glue does not conduct electricity and so the glued item will not plate properly. We recommend plating
                the component parts before assembly with glue.  
                <br><br>

                <b>Can enameled work be plated?  </b>
                <br><br>
                We have had mixed results with enameled items. Depending on the type of enamel and how it is fired,
                it can become dull or crack in the plating process. We will run a couple of test pieces for you.
                <br><br>

                 <b>What is thermal shock?</b>
                <br><br>
                  Our process baths are only about 150°F, but that is occasionally enough to crack come stones or enamel
                work. We cannot guarantee against cracking.   
                <br><br>

                <b>Can hollow items be plated?  </b>
                <br><br>
                Hollow parts will plate correctly if there are two holes that are large enough to allow free drainage
                of the solutions. Beads are not usually a problem but some will not drain freely and cannot be plated
                successfully. Liquid must be free to drain away in a few seconds. 
                <br><br>

                <b>Will plating "fill in" scratches, pits, or porosity?</b>
                <br><br>
                No. Plating does not flow on the way paint does and instead it will exaggerate any imperfections
                in the surface of the base metal.
                <br><br>

                  <b>How clean should items be when sent in for plating?</b>
                <br><br>
                  It is best to make every effort to completely clean any soil, polishing compound, or fingerprints from
                the surface of items before sending them in for plating. Polishing compounds such as Tripoli and rouge
                are corrosive and will slightly etch the surface if they are not removed soon after use. Ultrasonic
                cleaning is excellent for cleaning jewelry and component parts.    
                <br><br>

                <b>Is there a risk of lost parts? Why?  </b>
                <br><br>
                Sometimes parts fall off the plating rack when they cannot be secured to the rack properly. Parts
                require a through hole, post, closed finding, or other design element that will allow for secure
                racking. It is also possible for very small, lightweight parts to climb up and out of a plating barrel.
                  We will make every effort to find lost parts but it is not always possible to locate those that have
                fallen into large process tanks.   Please see the Red Sky Corporation Statement of Policy at the bottom
                of this page.  
                <br><br>

                <b>Are fingerprints on the surface of items a problem?</b>
                <br><br>
                  Yes. Avoid touching items after cleaning. Hand oil is acidic and can actually etch into the metal so
                that an almost invisible fingerprint becomes very noticeable after plating. This problem can be avoided
                by using cotton gloves to handle clean parts.   
                <br><br>

                <b>Will plating make parts brighter?  </b>
                <br><br>
                Plating may increase brightness. Changes in surface brightness can be subtle or great depending on a
                number of variables in both the pre-finishging and the plating process steps.  Please tell us about your
                desired outcome. On your purchase order, instruct us on whether you want as little change as possible
                or if you want deliberate changes in the finish or brightness.  
                <br><br>

                <b>Can Red Sky maintain an existing surface finish?</b>
                <br><br>
                  We use special procedures to handle items with customer-applied textures such as brush finishes or
                media-blasted surfaces.
                <br><br>

                <b>  Does Red Sky do any pre-plate finishing?  </b>
                <br><br>
                Yes. We offer mechanical finishing such as tumbling, bead-blasting, and sand-blasting. We are not
                equipped to hand polish items.   
                <br><br>

                <b>Will surface texture influence color?</b>
                <br><br>
                  Yes. The way we perceive color is influenced by brightness. A slight variation in the way items are
                finished can make a noticeable difference in the apparent color. For example, a slightly dull surface
                will appear pale compared to a shiny surface that is the same actual color.  
                <br><br>

                <b>Will my plating be harmed by further processing that takes place after plating?  </b>
                <br><br>
                Processes such as soldering, bending, tumbling, oxidizing, cutting, crimping, and engraving can ruin a
                good plated finish and we cannot guarantee plating that is subjected to further processing.   Please
                inform us of any further processing that will take place so that we can discuss procedures for the best
                possible results.  Please see the Red Sky Corporation Statement of Policy at the bottom of this page.
                <br><br>


                <b>Why is a nickel under-plate used when gold plating?</b>
                <br><br>
                 Nickel is used as a barrier to prevent the base metal from migrating into the gold layer and causing
                it to discolor and tarnish. It also adds brightness and the nickel's hardness extends the wear of the
                gold layer.
                <br><br>

                 <b>Does Red Sky provide nickel-free plating?  </b>
                <br><br>
                Yes, we can gold plate items without the use of nickel or we can substitute the nickel barrier
                with a layer of white bronze.  
                <br><br>

                <b>How does Red Sky measure plating thickness?  </b>
                <br><br>
                We use state-of-the-art x-ray florescence. This method is the industry standard for measuring plating
                thickness and it is very accurate.   
                <br><br>

                <b>How can I get samples of Red Sky's work?</b>
                <br><br>
                  FREE samples of our finishes are available upon request. We will send you examples of shiny and satin
                gold plating in a variety of gold colors.   
                <br><br>

                <b>What factors will influence the price of my order?</b>
                <br><br>
                 The most important factors we use to determine price are (1) the surface area that is plated with
                precious metal and (2) the coating thickness. Any special handling will also impact the price.  
                <br><br>

                <b>What is Red Sky's minimum order?</b>
                <br><br>
                 We have a $100.00 minimum per order.   If you are ordering more than one finish, for example some
                items plated with 14K gold and some with rhodium, there is a $50.00 minimum for each finish within the
                order.   A 5% hazardous waste management fee is added to each order.   
                <br><br>

                <b>How does the color of gold I choose influence my price?  </b>
                <br><br>
                Our gold plating is 98+% pure gold with a small amount of metal alloy to create various colors:
                14K, 18K, 24K, rose gold or green gold. We charge the same for all these colors because the gold content
                is very nearly the same in each.   
                <br><br>

                <b>How is payment handled?  </b>
                <br><br>
                We accept Visa and Mastercard. Automatic payment can also be established for ongoing orders by using
                your Visa or Mastercard. Open accounts will be considered after we receive a credit application. Credit
                applications take a few weeks to process.  
                <br><br>

                <b>How long will my order take?</b>
                <br><br>
                 We ship out most orders within five working days after receiving them. New accounts that require process
                development and/or very large orders may take longer.
                <br><br>

                 <b>How does Red Sky ship?  </b>
                <br><br>
                We ship UPS ground to addresses in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas. We ship UPS 2nd Day Air to
                all other locations unless otherwise instructed. In addition to the charge for shipping to your particular
                location, we charge a $5.00 shipping and handling fee on all packages shipped.
