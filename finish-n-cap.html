            <h1>Finishes and Capabilities</h1>
            <br>
            <p>
                Hundreds of manufacturers nationwide have come to rely on our expertise for both rack and barrel
                plating in a wide variety of finishes.
                <br><br>
                Our well-equipped quality lab features state-of-the-art x-ray fluorescence thickness testing and
                atomic absorption spectrophotometry for precise bath control.
                <br><br>
                We offer all of the finishes you see listed below, but If you need a finish that you don't see, let
                us knowâ€”we would like to provide it for you.
                <br><br>
                <b>GOLD</b>: Gold plating is our most popular process and we offer it in an assortment of colors including 14K
                gold, 18k gold, 24K gold, rose gold, and green gold. We are using acid gold chemistry to provide your
                jewelry with a hard and long wearing surface. You can specify gold thickness from a flash up to a full
                3 microns.
                <br><br>
                <b>VERMEIL</b>: (pronounced VER-MAY) We can gold plate your sterling silver items to the required thickness
                to meet the Federal Code: 2.5 microns (100 millionths) of gold over sterling silver. We use x-ray
                fluorescence to verify the thickness of your gold.
                <br><br>
                <b>RHODIUM</b>: Rhodium is a white precious metal and is one of the platinum group of metals. It is a hard,
                wear resistant coating and very resistant to tarnish.
                <br><br>
                <b>SILVER</b>: Our pure silver plate can be applied over sterling silver to brighten, increase the white color
                and add some resistance to tarnish. The whitest of all the precious metals, silver adds luster and
                sparkle to non-precious metals.
                <br><br>
                <b>NICKEL</b>: As a less expensive white metal, nickel can be used as a final finish or a barrier layer under
                gold. It is hard, resistant to tarnish, and adds brightness to the surface.
                <br><br>
                <b>NICKEL FREE</b>: We can gold plate items without using nickel or we can substitute the nickel barrier with a
                layer of white bronze.
                <br><br>
                <b>WHITE BRONZE</b>: This alloy of copper, tin, and zinc can be used as a substitute for nickel under gold
                plating. It will provide a barrier to prevent the base metal from migrating into the gold layer and
                causing tarnish.
                <br><br>
                <b>COPPER</b>: The unique red color of copper and can add an exciting variety to some jewelry styles.
                <br><br>
                <b>ANTI-TARNISH</b>: Applied electrolytically our special nanopolymer coating forms a protective layer on
                silver and other metallic surfaces. This is an invisible layer that is skin-friendly and hypoallergenic.
                <br><br>
                <b>TWO TONE PLATING</b>: We can do two-tone plating on some kinds of items. Please contact us to discuss the
                particulars of your project.
                <br><br>
                <b>RACK PLATING</b>: Rack plated items are individually attached to a plating rack with specially-designed
                clips or with copper wire. Items that are hand polished or are likely to nest, tangle, or
                bend will be rack plated.
                <br><br>
                <b>BARREL PLATING</b>: Another way to process parts is barrel plating. Items are placed in a
                slowly-rotating, perforated cylinder and proceed through the plating cycle as a group.
                <br><br>
                <b>SAND AND BEAD BLASTING</b>: Satin and matte finishes and textures are created by blasting with
                sand or glass bead media. This process is done before items are plated.
                <br><br>
                <b>ANTIQUE FINISHES</b>: We can provide an antique finish on some types of items. Usually these are
                items that we have silver barrel plated, copper barrel plated, or are made of brass. Contact us to
                discuss your special project.
                <br><br>
                <b>TUMBLE FINISHING</b>: We can clean and brighten the surface of some types of items by tumble finishing
                in cutting media, steel shot, or both. We are not equipped to do hand polishing or buffing.
